# SQL vs No.SQL 
SQL - relational databases, No.SQL - non-relational databases.
Differ in following aspects:
1. Way they built
2. Kind of information they store
3. Storage method they use

*Relational databases* -  are structured and predefined schema.<br>
*Non Relational databases* - Un structured, distributed and dynamic schema.

## SQL
eg: MySQL, Postgres etc..

## No.SQL 
### Type of No.SQL databases

#### Key-value stores
Array of key-value pairs.Eg. redis

#### Document based
Data is stored in documents. documents are grouped together in collections. Each document can have different structure.<br>
Eg. MongoDB, CouchDB

#### Wide-column databases
Instead of tables, we have column families, which are containers for rows.We don't have to know column type upfront. and each row doesnot have to have same number of columns.

Best suited for analyzing large datasets. eg. cassandra

#### Graph databases
Relational are best represented in graph databases. eg: InfiniteGraph, Neo4J


### High level differences b/w SQL and NoSQL

_Storage_

SQL - row represents an entity and each column represents a data point about that entity.<br>
NOSQL - key value store, document, graph and columnar

_Schema_

SQL - Conforms to a fixed schema.<br>
NOSQL - schemas are dyamic. 


_QUerying_

SQL - SQL (structured query language).<br>
NoSQL - UnQL (Unstructured query language)

_Scalability_
SQL - most commonly, are vertically scalable. Can scale horizontally but challenging and time consuming process.<br>
NoSQL - Horizontally scalable. Cheap to scale. cost effective than vertical scaling.

_Reliability or ACID compliance_

SQL - relational databases are ACID compliant.reliable and safe guarantee of performing transactions.<br>
NoSQL - sacrife ACID compliant for performance and scalability

###### SQL vs No.SQL - Which one to use?
No one size fits-all-solutions 

#### Use SQL Databases
1. to ensure ACID compliance. reduces anomalities. protects integrity o database.
2. Data is structured and unchanging. Business is not experiencing massive growth that would require more servers 
3. Consistent data

#### Use No.SQL databases
1. When other components are fast and seemless
2. Big data contributing large success for No.SQL databases
3. No limits to type of data to be stored. types can grow 
4. Rapid developement.
