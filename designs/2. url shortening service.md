# URL Shortening service

#### Requirements
Generate 6 characters unique string

### 1. Encoding the actual URL

h(actual url) -> hashed string

If we use MD5 for hashing, it produces hash of 128 bits which is generally represented in hexadecimal. Each hexadecimal character stored using 4 bits (i.e 2^4 = 16).<br>
So, 128 / 4 = 32. MD5 hash produces the string of length 32 characters.

But we need only 6 characters out of those 32 characters. How to produce 6 characters out of 32?

Possible solution : Take 6 first or last 6 characters from MD5 produced 32 character hash

But there is a possibility of duplication
