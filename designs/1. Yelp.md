# Yelp System design
Store the location of different business (eg. restaurants, coffee shops, etc) and enable user to search/view the near by places based on current location.
##  Algorithm
Store the locations, and retrieve them effectively and efficiently.

## Techniques

### SQL Solution
Store the location of each business in **location** table with two columns **latitude and longitude**. Have **indexes** on the both the columns for faster search

For searching the table query would look like:

    select *from locations where latitude between X-D and X-D and longitude between Y-D and Y+D;
    
D is the distance within the current location. Above query will fetch two large lists, and perform the interesection of two lists which is very expensive.

### Grid solution
