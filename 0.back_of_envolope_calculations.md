# Bytes conversion
8 bits - 1 byte<br>
1024 bytes - 1 kilo byte<br>
1024 kilo bytes - 1 mega byte<br>
1024 mega bytes - 1 Giga byte<br>
1024 Giga bytes - 1 Tera byte

# Common data types
char - 1 byte<br>
integer - 4 bytes<br>
unix time stamp - 4 bytes


# Time
Seconds in an hour - 3600<br>
Seconds in a day - 86400<br>
Seconds in a month - 2592000 (25,00,000 i.e 25x10^5)

# General calculations
10 Lakh - 1 Million (10^6)<br>
10 M - 1 Crore (10^7)<br>
1000 M (**10^3 M**) - 1 Billion (10^9)<br>
1000000 M (**10^6 M**) - 1 Trillion (10^12)

# Traffic estimates

Read requests or read traffic <br>
Write quests or write traffic 

> Average daily active users x  average reads / writes 

## Example 
Lets assume a photo application, where user upload images and sees own uploaded images and others images.

Let average daily active users = 10 Million.

Average read / day = 30 photos<br>
Average writes / day = 1 photo

Reads:  10 million x 30 photos = 300 million photos/ day<br>
Writes: 10 million x 1 photo = 10 million photos / day

converting them into per second
Reads: 300 million / 86400 = 3472 photo read requests / second<br>
Writes: 10 million / 86400 = 115 photo write /upload requests / second

so, **3742 read requests / second**. | **115 photo uploads / second**
