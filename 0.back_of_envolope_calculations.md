# Bytes conversion
8 bits - 1 byte<br>
1024 bytes - 1 kilo byte<br>
1024 kilo bytes - 1 mega byte<br>
1024 mega bytes - 1 Giga byte<br>
1024 Giga bytes - 1 Tera byte

# Common data types
char - 1 byte<br>
integer - 4 bytes<br>
unix time stamp - 4 bytes


# Time
Seconds in an hour - 3600<br>
Seconds in a day - 86400<br>
Seconds in a month - 2592000 (25,00,000 i.e 25x10^5)

# General calculations
10 Lakh - 1 Million (10^6)<br>
10 M - 1 Crore (10^7)<br>
1000 M (**10^3 M**) - 1 Billion (10^9)<br>
1000000 M (**10^6 M**) - 1 Trillion (10^12)

# Traffic estimates

Read requests or read traffic <br>
Write quests or write traffic 

> Average daily active users x  average reads / writes 

## Example 
Lets assume a photo application, where user upload images and sees own uploaded images and others images.

Let average daily active users = 10 Million.

Average read / day = 30 photos<br>
Average writes / day = 1 photo

Reads:  10 million x 30 photos = 300 million photos/ day<br>
Writes: 10 million x 1 photo = 10 million photos / day

converting them into per second
Reads: 300 million / 86400 = 3472 photo read requests / second<br>
Writes: 10 million / 86400 = 115 photo write /upload requests / second

so, **3742 read requests / second**. | **115 photo uploads / second**


# Memory estimates
Note: Its not storage estimate. Memory is for caching.

> Read requests per day x average request size x 0.20 

300 million x 500  bytes = 150 Gb

150 Gb x 0.20 (Because of 80/20 rule | Only 20% of the data need to be cached for fast retrival) = 30 Gb

30 Gb x 3 (replicas) = 90 Gb.


# Bandwidth estimates

> Requests per day x Request size

300 million requests x 1.5 MB = 450 x 10^ 6 MB = 450000 Gb <br>
450000 gb / 86400 seconds = **5.2 Gb / second** 


# Storage estimates

> Writes per day x size of write x Time to store data
