# Redundancy and replication
**Redundancy**<br>
Duplication of critical components or functions of a system with the intention of increasing the reliability of the system.
Usually in the form of a backup or fail-safe, or to improve actual system performance.

Avoids single point of faiure. Keeps backups needed in crisis. 


**Replication**<br>
Sharing information to ensure consistency b/w redundant resources, such as software or hardware components, to improve reliability, fault-tolerance, or accessibility.

Widely used in many database managment systems (DBMS).
Usually with a master-slave relationship b/w the original and the copies.

Master gets all the updates, which then ripple through to the slaves. Each slave outputs a message stating that it has received the update successfully, thus allowing sending subsequent updates.
