# CAP Theorem

CAP theorem states that it is **impossible** for a distributed software system to simultaneously provide more than two out of three of the following guarantees

CAP is almost the first thing we want to consider 

CAP theorem says while designing a distributed system we can pick only **two** of the following three options:

## Consistency
1. All users / nodes see the same data at the same time
2. Achieved by **updating** several nodes before allowing further reads

## Availability
1. System continues to function even with node failure
2. Every request gets a response on success / failure.
3. Achieved by **replicating** the data across different servers 

## Partition tolerance
System continues to function even if the communication fails between nodes
