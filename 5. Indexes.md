# Indexes
When known when it comes to databases.
Database **performance** no longer satisfactory.
Indexes are for optimizing data access.

First thing, we need to lookup to is **database indexing**.

**Goal of indexing**: _Make it faster search through the table and find the rows that we want_.

###### How indexes are created?
Indexes are created using **one or more columns** of database table.

_Analogy_: Indexing chapters in book.

###### What is index?
Its a data structure that can be perceived as table of contents that points us to location where actual data is stored.

When we create an index on a column of the table , we store that column and pointer to the whole row in the index.

Trick: We must carefully consider how users will access the data.

###### How do indexes decrease write performance?
Because: It involves updating keys when we update data

It applies to updates like insert, update, and delete.

## Care / Best practise
Avoid using indexes unnecessarily.
Remove indexes which are no longer needed.
