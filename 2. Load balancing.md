# Load balancing (LB)

Critital component of distributed system.
Spread the traffic across cluster of servers to improve **responsiveness** and **availability** of applications, websites, or databases.

LB keeps track of servers status while distributing traffic to resources.  If a server stopped responding, LB will stop sending traffic to server.

LB can be placed in b/w following layers:
1. b/w user and the web server 
2. b/w the webserver and internal platform like application server
3. b/w internal platform layer and database

###### How does the load balancer choose the backend server?
Considers two factors: 1. Server they are going to choose is actually responding 2. Use pre-configured algorithm to select the server 

**Health checks** - Reguarly attempt to connect to backend servers to ensure servers are listening. <br>
If a server fails in health checks, it is removed from the pool until it respond to the health checks again.

### LB Algorithms
1. **Least connection method (LCM)** - 
2. **Least response time (LRT)** - 
3. **Least bandwidth time (LBT)** - 
4. **Round robin (RR)** - 
5. **Weighted round robin (WRR)** - 
6. **IP Hash** -
