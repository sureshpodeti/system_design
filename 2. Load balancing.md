# Load balancing (LB)

Critital component of distributed system.
Spread the traffic across cluster of servers to improve **responsiveness** and **availability** of applications, websites, or databases.

LB keeps track of servers status while distributing traffic to resources.  If a server stopped responding, LB will stop sending traffic to server.

LB can be placed in b/w following layers:
1. b/w user and the web server 
2. b/w the webserver and internal platform like application server
3. b/w internal platform layer and database

###### How does the load balancer choose the backend server?
Considers two factors: 1. Server they are going to choose is actually responding 2. Use pre-configured algorithm to select the server 

**Health checks** - Reguarly attempt to connect to backend servers to ensure servers are listening. <br>
If a server fails in health checks, it is removed from the pool until it respond to the health checks again.

### LB Algorithms
1. **Least connection method (LCM)** - Server with the *fewest active connections*. Useful when there are a large no.of persistent connections which are unevenly distributed b/w the servers.
2. **Least response time (LRT)** - Fewest active connections and lowest average time.
3. **Least bandwidth time (LBT)** - Least amount of traffic measured in mbps
4. **Round robin (RR)** - Sequentially in a list. When it reaches the end of the list, it starts over at the begining.
5. **Weighted round robin (WRR)** - Each server assigned a weight (integer indicates processing power). Server with highest connection receives new connections before those with less weights.
6. **IP Hash** - Hash of the IP address of the **client** is calculated 

## Redundant load balancers 
To avoid single point of failure at LB.
Connect second LB to first one to form cluster

Each LB monitors health of other. 

Both are capable of serving traffic and failure detection. In case of failure of first LB, second one will take over.
