# Long-polling vs web sockets vs Server-sent events

Popular communication protocols b/w client like web browser and web server.

Understanding HTTP Web request
1. The client opens a connection and requests data from the server
2. The server calculates the response
3. The server sends the response back to the client on the opened request

## Ajax Polling
Idea is client repeatedly polls ( or requests ) a server for data

The client
makes a request and waits for the server to respond with data. If no data is available,
an empty response is returned.
1. The client opens a connection and requests data from the server using regular
HTTP.
2. The requested webpage sends requests to the server at regular intervals (e.g.,
0.5 seconds).
3. The server calculates the response and sends it back, just like regular HTTP
traffic.
4. The client repeats the above three steps periodically to get updates from the
server.

**Problem**
Client keeps on asking for new data. A lot of response is empty.

## HTTP Long polling
In traditional polling; Allows server to push the information to client whenever the data is available.
In long polling; Client request inforamtion from server as a normal polling.with the expectation that server may not respond immediately.
also called hanging GET.

Instead of sending an emtpy response;servers holds the request and send it whenever data is available.
Then re-requests immedietly; almost have an available waiting request 

Long polling is used in a scenerio where the **updates to the data is rare**. <br>
Eg: Chat based applications, <br>
turn-based gaming applications - request is sent when every turn is complete, instead of relaying on repeated requests.
