# Sharding or data partitioning
Technique to breakup a big database into many parts.
Process of splitting up a DB/table across multiple machines to improve
1. manageability
2. performance
3. availability
4. load balancing of an application.

_Justification for data sharding_: After a certain scale point, it is cheaper and more feasible to scale horizontally by adding more machines than to grow it vertically by adding beefier servers.

# Partioning methods 
1. **Horizontal partitioning**  - Put different rows into different tables. Also called range based sharding. Care should be taken in select partioning scheme otherwise can lead to unbalanced servers.
2. **Vertical partitioning** - store tables related to a specific feature in their own server. eg. instagram users, photos, and people they follow can be stored on diffferent servers.<br> Main problem: for additional growth, it may be necessary to further partition a feature specific db across various servers.
3. **Directory based partitioning** - **Look up service** which knows your current paritioning scheme and abstracts it away from the DB access code. Query the directory server that holds the mapping b/w each tuple keys to its db server.<br>
 Use: We can perform tasks like adding servers to the DB pool or changing our parititioning scheme without having an impact on the application.

## Partitioning crieteria (On what basis we should partition database)

### 1. Key or hash based partitioning
A hash function takes some key attributes of the entity we are storing; yeilds the **partioning number**. 
eg: 
100 DB servers, our ID is a numberic value that gets incremented by one each time a new record is inserted. 
h(x) = x %  100. (i.e h(ID) = ID % 100)
Gives the server number (partition number) to store the data.

This approach should ensure we are storing uniformly over all servers. <br>
Problem: It effectively fixes total number of DB servers. Adding more servers means changing the hash function. (100 will change). Which would redistribute of data and downtime for the service.<br>
**Solution**: Consistent hashing

### 2. List partitioning
Each partition is assigned a list of values, so whenever we want to insert a new record. we will see which partition contains the key and then store it there.
eg: All users living in iceland, norway, sweden, finland, or denmark will be stored in a partition for nordic countries.

### 3. Round robin partitioning
Ensures uniform data distribution. with n partitions, the i tuple is assigned to partion i mod n

### Composite partitioning
Combine any of the above paritioning schemes to devise a new scheme. 
eg: apply list partitioning scheme and then a hash based partitioning. 

Consistent hashing = a composite of hash + list partioning 
hash reduces the key space to a size that can be listed. 

## Common problems of partitioning
Most of these problems: operations across multiple tables or multiple rows in the table no longer run on the same server.

### Joins and denormalization
Running joins on different parititioned servers will be no longer efficient.<br>
**solution**: denormalize; so that joins can be performed from single table.

### Referential integrity
????

### Rebalancing
Some of reasons for rebalancing:
1. The data distribution is **not** uniform. Eg. There are lot of places for a particular ZIP code that cannot fit into one database partition
2. There is a lot of load on a shard. eg. there are too many requests being handled by the DB shard dedicated to user photos.

Problem: Existing data moved to new locations. Doing this without incurring down time is extemely difficult.

Solution: Directory based partitioning makes rebalancing easy at the cost of increasing complexity and creating a new single point of failure ( i.e lookup service/ database)
